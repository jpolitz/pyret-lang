@title[#:tag "runtime"]{Runtime API}

Pyret exposes most of its internal operations on the @tt{runtime} object; most
JavaScript code that interacts with Pyret will need to know about the runtime.

The library that defines runtimes is in @tt{src/js/base/runtime-anf.js}, and it
is configured to be importable with @tt{js/runtime-anf} via RequireJS:

@verbatim{
define(["js/runtime-anf"], function(runtimeLib) {
  // use runtimeLib
});
}

@doc-internal["RuntimeLib" "create" (list "options") "Runtime"]

Create a new Pyret runtime.  The @tt{RuntimeLib} value itself only exports
this interface, and most other useful functions are referenced from the
runtime objecs it creates.  The options are:

@verbatim{
  options :: {
    initialGas: Number,
    stdout: String → Undefined,
    stderr: String → Undefined
  }
}

The size of the Pyret stack is constrained to @tt{initialGas} frames; most
applications have little need to set this.

For applications that need control over printing, they can set @tt{stdout} and
@tt{stderr} to get called whenever Pyret would print strings (e.g. via
@tt{print}).  This interface may change to accept all Pyret values at some
point, to allow for richer rendering interfaces.

@section{The Pyret Runtime}

The return value of @internal-id["RuntimeLib" "create"] is a runtime
object with many useful methods for programmatically interacting with Pyret.

@subsection{Loading Pyret Modules}

Pyret modules' source can be located with RequireJS by referencing them as
dependencies in @tt{define}.  To instantiate the modules, the Pyret runtime
provides a special mechanism.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "loadModules" (list "JSNamespace" "JSArray<PyretModule>" "(PyretModuleResult ... → a)") "a" #:stack-unsafe #t]

This call runs the body of the given modules in order, and passes the results
to the provided callback.  Any return value of the callback is ignored.  In
most cases, the value of @tt{runtime.namespace} is appropriate for the first
argument.

Example:

@verbatim{
define(["js/runtime-anf", "trove/lists"], function(runtimeLib, listLib) {
  var myRuntime = runtimeLib.makeRuntime({});
  myRuntime.loadModules(myRuntime.namespace, [listLib], function(list) {
    // list has fields like "link", "map", etc. from the lists module
  });
});
}

@subsection{Creating Values}

@doc-internal["Runtime" "makeNumber" (list "JSNumber") "PyretNumber"]

@doc-internal["Runtime" "makeNumberFromString" (list "JSString") "PyretNumber"]

Parses the string and creates a representation of the number that avoids float
overflows and can represent very large and very small rationals exactly.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "makeString" (list "JSString") "PyretString"]

The representation of Pyret strings is JS strings, though this may change to
accommodate better Unicode support in the future.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "pyretTrue" #f "PyretBoolean"]
@doc-internal["Runtime" "pyretFalse" #f "PyretBoolean"]

The runtime values for @pyret{true} and @pyret{false} in Pyret.  Representation
is JavaScript @tt{true} and @tt{false}.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "makeArray" (list "JSArray") "PyretRawArray"]

Creates a Pyret @pyret-id["RawArray" "raw-arrays"] with the given elements.
Currently the identity function: Pyret raw arrays are JavaScript arrays.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "makeObject" (list "JSObj") "PyretObject"]

Creates a Pyret object with the fields in the input object.  The representation
of an object is @emph{not} one-to-one with JS objects.

The fields of a Pyret object go in the @tt{dict} field of the JS object, and
the JS object has an additional field called @tt{brands}, which hold
information about an object's type information (if it has any).
@pyret-id["StringDict" "string-dict"]s, for example, are branded objects.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "makeFunction" (list "JSFunction") "PyretFunction"]

Returns a Pyret function backed by the provided JS function.  The Pyret
function will @emph{not} do any arity checks on behalf of the JS function, so
any arity checks need to be done explicitly (see @internal-id["Runtime"
"checkArity"]).  The function can be accessed directly via the @pyret{app}
field of the Pyret function, but read the section on @internal-id["Runtime"
"safeCall"] in order to suitably protect calls to Pyret functions.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "makeMethodN" (list "JSFunction") "PyretMethod"]


@subsection{Interacting with Objects}

@doc-internal["Runtime" "getField" (list "PyretObject" "JSString") "PyretValue"]

Gets the field with the given name from the object.  If the field is a method,
it is automatically curried over the object, as with dot.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "getColonField" (list "PyretObject" "JSString") "PyretValue"]

Gets the field with the given name from the object.  If the field is a method,
no additional work is performed.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "getFields" (list "PyretObject") "JSArray<String>"]

Returns all the field names of the given object.

@doc-internal["Runtime" "hasField" (list "PyretObject" "JSString") "JSBoolean"]

Checks if the given object has the named field.

@subsection{Assertions}

@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkArity" (list "JSNumber" "Arguments" "JSString") "Undefined"]

Checks that the given argument list has the given arity.  Throws an exception
if they don't match.

There are a number of checking functions that check that a given argument is of
a particular type, and throw an exception if not:

@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkNumber" (list "Any") "Undefined"]
@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkString" (list "Any") "Undefined"]
@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkBoolean" (list "Any") "Undefined"]
@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkObject" (list "Any") "Undefined"]
@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkFunction" (list "Any") "Undefined"]
@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkMethod" (list "Any") "Undefined"]
@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkArray" (list "Any") "Undefined"]



@doc-internal["Runtime" "checkPyretVal" (list "Any") "Undefined"]

@subsection{Equality}

@doc-internal["Runtime" "combineEquality" (list "EqualityResult" "EqualityResult") "EqualityResult"]

Takes two @pyret-id["EqualityResult" "equality"]s and combines them.  Any value
paired with @pyret-id["NotEqual" "equality"] produces @pyret-id["NotEqual"
"equality"], any combination of @pyret-id["Equal" "equality"] and
@pyret-id["Unknown" "equality"] produces @pyret-id["Unknown" "equality"], and
two @pyret-id["Equal" "equality"] values produce @pyret-id["Equal" "equality"].

@subsection{FFI Helpers}

@doc-internal["Runtime" "ffi" #f "FFIHelpers"]

The Pyret runtime instantiates an @seclink["ffi" (list @tt{FFIHelpers} " object")] and
stores in in the @tt{ffi} field.
